### COVID-19 Data Analysis (Beginner Project)
#### What is this project?

This is a simple data analysis project about COVID-19 using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
We looked at real-world COVID-19 data and made easy graphs to understand the spread of the virus.

##### Why did we do this?

To practice Python data analysis skills.

To learn how to read, clean, and understand data.

To see patterns in COVID-19 cases and deaths.

To visualize data clearly and simply.

###### Data Source

The data comes from the World Health Organization (WHO).
We used a small sample of the dataset, so it is easy and fast to run.

###### What factors we looked at

Daily new COVID-19 cases (How many new infections each day?)

Daily deaths (How many people died each day?)

Total cases over time (Cumulative cases)

Cases by country (Which countries had more or fewer cases?)

Cases by WHO region (AFR, EUR, AMR, etc.)

ðŸ›  Tools we used

Pandas â†’ To load and clean data

Matplotlib & Seaborn â†’ To make graphs

Streamlit (optional) â†’ To make a small web app

##### What we learned

How to load a CSV file into Pandas.

How to take a sample of data for testing.

How to make bar charts and line charts.

How to group data by country and region.

###### How to run this project

Install Python 3 and these libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn streamlit


Save the .py file.

Run the script:

python covid_analysis.py


If using Streamlit:

streamlit run covid_app.py

###### Why this project is easy

We used a small sample dataset.

We wrote simple, step-by-step code with comments.

We used basic visualizations (line chart, bar chart).

No advanced math or machine learning needed.
